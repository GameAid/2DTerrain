This is a project to create an open source set of 2D terrain tiles. The primary idea is to have the hi-res source files available so that these tiles can be used for years to come, exported to appropriate sizes as needed. 
Collaboration is welcome. 

Initial tile size is 256x256 but probably should be made much larger for futureproofing.

256x256 tiles are added to the `all_terrain.psd` file. It is saved out at 25% size to `all_terrain.png` to create 64x64 tiles that are tested in the Tiled `test_map.tmx`.

More info coming soon.
